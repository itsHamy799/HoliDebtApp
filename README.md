# HoliDebtApp
With the HoliDebt app, users can track their winter holiday gift expenses by allowing them to enter their budget and their expenses to visualize their leftover balance. This is useful because users may use multiple forms of payment when doing their shopping so they are not able to view all their expenses in one collective area. That's where HoliDebt comes to use by offering that exact service.
